- Git Status is the best command to make sure you don't do something stupid like create a repo inside a repo
- Be careful with `git commit .` - by only adding specific files, we have more control and 
  organization with our commits. Example: working on javascript and CSS, adding each one 
  separately makes the commits more focused.
