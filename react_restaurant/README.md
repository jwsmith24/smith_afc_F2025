# Project 2 - React Restaurant Refactor

## Notes on project requirements:
- Used Tailwind CSS and Shadcn instead of Reactstrap for the styling/component libraries to 
  line up with current best practices on the floor.
- Used ReactHookForms with Zod for form validation
  - With free types from Zod type inference
  - HiringData type is defined in `types/HiringData.tsx`
- Used Tailwind CSS, react-router, and conditional rendering to write my own reusable collapsible 
  navbar component.
