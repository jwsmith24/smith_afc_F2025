# Technical Documentation

Configured a Vite + React + Typescript project with Tailwind and React Router, using the 
technical docs from Vite, Tailwind, and React Router to guide the setup. 

Additionally used Tailwind docs to learn more about how to use tools like `component` more effectively for 
responsive layouts. Used shadcn docs to guide implementation of their form component that 
leverages react-hook-forms and Zod validation

# React Basics
Setup routing in main.tsx IAW project requirements. Structured App.tsx to act as a consistent 
layout component, using `Outlet` which is a placeholder for where a active child route will render.
